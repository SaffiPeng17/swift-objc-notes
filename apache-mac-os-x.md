# Apache @Mac OS X


#### ✢ Notes

* The Apache server is already in Mac OS X.
* The **httpd.conf** file is private, therefore it have to be modify by root.
* If you need to use PHP module, modify **httpd.conf** file. It is closed by default.
* The file path of web site is **/Library/WebServer/Documents** by default.
    * If you need to change default file path, have to consider the **user permission** of file.
