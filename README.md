# The thorny road of Swift & Objective-C

On the way of learning Swift and Objective-C is like a thorny road full of sweat and tears. I am still learning and I am never give up.

Haha, actually it is just my learning note. After I struggle from problems, error, mess information, I leave something I have known. Maybe someone can find their answer here. Good Luck.
